# Game 5 - LD 45 - USP GameDev

Racing sideview game 2D, with physics, with spring joints.

You enter the game, and you design the chasis of your car. The game will show 2 points that define the axis of the wheel. The player draws the car in 2 parts:

1. Wide stroke: Influences gameplay, restrictive, just one stroke to be able to close the shape, auto-closes the shape if shape is open.
2. Variable stroke: Does not influence the gamplay. Draws decorative details to the chasis. Total freedom to the player, different colors.

If the design is bigger, the car is slower but has more life.

Then the player designs each of the wheels. The game shows a single point indicating the axis of the wheel. The wheel also needs to be a closed shape.

Then the player designs the cannon for their car. It is purely cosmetic.

Then the player designs the bullet. If the area is big, the speed will be slower but the damage will be higher.

The AI enemies will have 3 tiers of cars:

1. Tank car
2. Fast car
3. Heavy-fire car

AI will be simple.

The terrain will have slopes. It may be procedurally generated, or hand-made.

The player drives the car by accelerating and braking, turn the inclination, and fire the missile.
